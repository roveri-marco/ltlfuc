  The original instances are taken from

  and

  V. Schuppan scaled up instances in amba from 2-9 to 2-18 and in
  genbuf from 1-10 to 1-20 and added variants c and cl. Variant c uses
  a conjunction between assumptions and guarantees rather than an
  implication. Variant cl additionally lets each master own the bus
  infinitely often (amba) or requires each sender to request to send
  infinitely often (genbuf).
