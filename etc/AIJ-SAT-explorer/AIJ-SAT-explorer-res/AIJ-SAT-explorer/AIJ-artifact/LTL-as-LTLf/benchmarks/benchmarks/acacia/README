- description:
  
  The original instances are taken from
  acacia_0.3.8.3_linux_i386.tar.gz. That contains instances from Lily
  and adds some variants.

  V. Schuppan scaled up instances in demo-v3 to from 1-6 to 1-12 and
  added variants c and cl. Variant c uses a conjunction between
  assumptions and guarantees rather than an implication. Variant cl
  additionally requires every request to be true infinitely often.
